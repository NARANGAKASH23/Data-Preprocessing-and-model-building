# Data-Preprocessing-and-model-building
Machine Learning Project in Finance Domain
Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Numpy

Project Overview: Developed a comprehensive credit risk profiling model to assess the likelihood of loan defaults for a financial institution.

Key Responsibilities:

Data Collection & Preparation: Gathered and cleaned large datasets from multiple sources, ensuring data integrity and completeness.

Feature Engineering: Created and selected relevant features using statistical techniques such as chi square test, ANOVA, Variance Inflation Factor to improve model performance, including demographic, behavioral, and financial indicators.

Model Development: Implemented various machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict default risk, optimizing hyperparameters for accuracy.

Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as AUC-ROC, precision, and recall.
